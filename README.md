Today is another ordinary day. I don't feel tired when I go to work every day. Now I begin to understand why people say that they miss their high school career when they are in college. When they work, they will miss their college days. The student days are really the happiest and carefree period. When they are in society, there will be so many involuntarily, I'm as tired as a dog at work every day. Human beings are amazing. Today's java learning is really difficult, but I have to learn it. I just want to get rid of here and go to work in a big factory as soon as possible.
